== Text Jason App

A simple webapp using the Twilio API to schedule text messages for my roommate Jason. This app was created because of the many times I forgot to remind Jason to do something after he asked me to remind him. I thought it would be easier just to build an app for him instead of remembering to remind him about things.


You can find a running instance of this app here: https://text-jason.herokuapp.com
